                <h2>What this book about?</h2>
<ol>
<li>How habit works?</li>
<li>How to develop a new habit?</li>
<li>How to get out of a bad habit?</li>
</ol>
<h2>The first shock from this book.</h2>
<ol>
<li>People now get used to the habits of using toothpaste to brush their teeth, but this habit doesn't exist for majority people in the world 50 years ago. A clever advertiser actually build this habit for the rest of the people to help selling the toothpaste.</li>
<li>It's said using toothpaste is not really useful at all. But people like the cool feeling when using toothpaste and this reminds them they have done a routine.</li>
<li>Not just toothpaste, many things that are now <em>considered a necesssary</em> in original people's shopping cart, are <em>not</em> common 50 or 100 years go.  Economics development is an imporant factor. But we should ask ourselves, how we come to the habit of using them?</li>
<li>People developed the habits of using something and then feel it's a necessary.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why the book is useful for me?</h2>
<ol>
<li>it actually make it clear, habit, like many things else, can be <em>developed</em>.</li>
<li>Individual can use the same techinque to develop <em>good</em> habits that can make their life better.</li>
<li>Once the habit is there, it actually works by itself. People who has the habit to get up earlier don't consider it a pain to get up earlier anymore, as it become their habit.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why the book is useful for corporates?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Like individuals, companies also have their habits.</li>
<li>By developing a powerful and healthy habit, a company can realize substantial competitive advantage over oters.</li>
<li>The book give out a great example. CEO Paul O'Neill set the habit of alwasy string for 0 injuries for the company, which turns out to change a lot of things.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to develop a habit?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Find a Cue - a trigger for doing something.</li>
<li>Routine - what actually get done.</li>
<li>Reward - positive feedback if done.</li>
<li>Craving for reward - the hidded force. This is the driving force behind every good or bad habit. it's important find find the craving.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Not all habits are created equal</h2>
<ol>
<li>a few habits, also knowns as <em>keynote habit</em> play a much important role than other habits.</li>
<li>By focusing on developing one or two <em>keynote habit</em>, it's said other habits, usually good ones, will naturally come.</li>
<li>An example of such <em>keynote habits</em> is daily exercise.</li>
