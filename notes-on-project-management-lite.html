    <p>The book caught my attention when I was looking for a book that can get me started with just enough project management skills. I was working on an internal project at that time. After comparing a few books on project management, I think this one is the best one with <strong>just enough</strong> things i need to know to get through.</p>
<p>I'd recommend this book to anyone who has few experience in project management and need to manage a project by herself.</p>

<li>It might have a budget, an amount of money set aside to cover the the costs.</li>
<li>It may require a team of people to work on it or it could just be you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
