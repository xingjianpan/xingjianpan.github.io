    <p>I have recently switched to using two laptops in work, and I feel this is a great move, I am able to be more focused, more productive, and less time wasted on keep everything in sync.</p>
<h3>What's my situation</h3>
<ol>
<li>My work laptop is a Dell Latitude E6410, I have been using it for 3 years and it recently get upgraded to Win 7. It's a standard business laptop. It can do the work, but it feels quite slow and there is not much joy using it.</li>
<li>I spent quite a lot time on writing code in python and I am the admin of two internal websites which are built in a linux box. I am more comfortable using linux-like systems instead of Windows.</li>
<li>However, I also need to use a lot of Microsoft Softwares, like Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, sharepoints, Webex,  Microsoft SQL server, etc.</li>
<li>I can not simply moving to MacOS or Linux, because all my colleagues are using Windows as their primary system.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What problems I have</h3>
<ol>
<li>Windows is not very suitable for developing websites with python. Many libraries that can be easily installed on linux may require a lot of small fixes or workaround to get it work on Windows.</li>
<li>It's hard to switch tools, like IDE.</li>
<li>Working on MBP is easier for developing, but it's difficult to use business softwares.</li>
</ol>
<h3>My solutions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bring my MacBook Pro to work.</li>
<li>Use company laptop for mails, and necessary business softwares.</li>
<li>Everything else on macbook pro. including coding, writing things.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://yun.baidu.com">Baidu Yun</a> to keep in sync.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Feeling after using two laptops for a week</h3>
<ol>
<li>I feel more focused and more productive.</li>
<li>I spent less time worrying about syncing files.</li>
<li>I spent less time to fix things that doesn't work on windows.</li>
<li>Bonus:I looks cooler cause I am the only one using a Mac in the office :)</li>
</ol>
